* Files:

- wordlist.txt is from https://github.com/elkmovie/hsk30;
- hsk1-csv-generator.py creates a .csv file with four fields: a word
  written in simplified Chinese characters, its corresponding pinyin,
  meaning and audio.
- hsk1.csv was generated using the 'hsk1-csv-generator.py', and
  modified manually. The following changes were made:

** Words that had their generated translation changed:

| Word | Generated translation                                           | Fixed translation |
| 车   | war chariot (archaic), rook (in Chinese chess), rook (in chess) | car               |
| 那   | (archaic) many, beautiful, how, old variant of 挪[nuo2]         | that              |
| 女   | archaic variant of 汝[ru3]                                      | female            |
| 年   | grain, harvest (old), variant of 年[nian2]                      | year              |

** Words that weren't translated:
  
| Word | Translation      |
| 车上 | in the car       |
| 看到 | to see           |
| 请坐 | please, sit down |
| 在家 | at home          |
| 真的 | really           |

** Missing word due to parenthesis

| Word   | Meaning | Was |
| 有一些 | some    | 有  |

** Duplicate character

In HSK 1, there are three characters that are the same, but can have
different meaning and pronunciation. 
Because of that, I renamed the audios in the csv file to '地1.mp3' and
'地2.mp3', for instance.

| Character | Pinyin 1 | Meaning 1                          | Pinyin 2 | Meaning 2            |
| 地        | de       | makes the preceding word an adverb | dì       | earth, ground, floor |
| 干        | gān      | to concern                         | gàn      | do                   |
| 还        | hái      | still, yet                         | huán     | to return            |

Some audio files were downloaded from both Forvo and Wiktionary.
